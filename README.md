Contributing to an IRD project at IIT Delhi focused on developing groundbreaking technology for detecting underground pipe leaks or dents instantly over very large distances.
Collaborating across Physics (Optics and Photonics), Civil Engineering, and Machine Learning disciplines.
Applying machine learning algorithms to convert the signal into useful data to detect leaks or dents in pipes below ground level.
Starting with FFT transformation of the signal and then decreasing signal noise with a high-pass filter.
Practicing processing human audio and training a machine learning model to clear noise with various filters, and then identify a person's voice with attributes of pitch, maximum amplitude, and frequency range in the audio.
 Then will develop new software which can do signal processing and extract features once the hardware is completed.
